The work collected here embodied my learning in the 2-year Master of Architecture degree program at Taubman College, University of Michigan, covering a range of scales, exploring the potentials of architectural objects and pushing their limits into environments, experiences, and atmospheres.

My study interest revolves around the aesthetics, materiality and techniques in architectural surfaces including but not limited to: drawings, screens (as working places), facades, enclosures, and landscape (as project sites). 

The projects assembled here attempt to engage in the larger discourse of contemporary design and architectural education.
