- Professional Practice
	- Our group wants to invent a special dumpster. It could recognize the reusable materials we throw inside and send notifications to people nearby who want them.

	- The theme of my section (Maria's section) is public engagement and education. The goal is to increase the accessibility and invite the people to visit the restricted area while the brownfield is undergoing mitigation.
	- The idea of my project is to use screens and projectors as long-distance intervention, at the mean time, take advantage of the wind-spread seeds to re-wild the abandoned steel plants along the Detroit River.
	- I thought about making short movies or creating some video games to better explain my idea and engage with the visitors.
