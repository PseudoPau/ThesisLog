The work collected here is done during the 2-year Master of Architecture degree program at Taubman College, University of Michigan, covering a range of scales, exploring the potentials of the architectural objects and pushing their limits into environments, experiences, and atmospheres.
My interest revolves around the aesthetics, materiality and techniques in architectural surfaces around us including drawings and screens as working places, facade systems and urban landscape as a site. 
The projects assembled here attempt to engage 
for addressing the ecolofical imperatives of contemporary design culture globally.
