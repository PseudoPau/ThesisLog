Organized around eight design techniques- rendering, scanning, modeling, controlling, specifying, networking, imaging, and lodging - this project blends discourses in architecture, media studies, history of technology and philosophy"--},

  abstract = {Electrifying, provocative, and controversial when first published thirty years ago, Donna Haraway’s “Cyborg Manifesto” is even more relevant today, when the divisions that she so eloquently challenges—of human and machine but also of gender, class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and location—are increasingly complex. The subsequent “Companion Species Manifesto,” which further questions the human–nonhuman disjunction, is no less urgently needed in our time of environmental crisis and profound polarization.Manifestly Haraway brings together these momentous manifestos to expose the continuity and ramifying force of Haraway’s thought, whose significance emerges with engaging immediacy in a sustained conversation between the author and her long-term friend and colleague Cary Wolfe. Reading cyborgs and companion species through and with each other, Haraway and Wolfe join in a wide-ranging exchange on the history and meaning of the manifestos in the context of biopolitics, feminism, Marxism, human–nonhuman relationships, making kin, literary tropes, material semiotics, the negative way of knowing, secular Catholicism, and more.The conversation ends by revealing the early stages of Haraway’s “Chthulucene Manifesto,” in tension with the teleologies of the doleful Anthropocene and the exterminationist Capitalocene. Deeply dedicated to a diverse and robust earthly flourishing, Manifestly Haraway promises to reignite needed discussion in and out of the academy about biologies, technologies, histories, and still possible futures.},

\par
\texttt{“Today, geopolitics is also concerned with wars over the definition of the stage itself. A conflict will be called, from now on, “of planetary relevance” not because it has the planet for a stage, but because it is about which planet you are claiming to inhabit and defend.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
It is important to frame the field and clarify the definition before we start a conversation. It is crucial to read the information behind the written words when given a commission from a client to avoid trouble.
\par
\texttt{“The climate question is not one aspect of politics among others, but that which defines the political order from beginning to end, forcing all of us to redefine the older questions of social justice along with those of identity, subsistence, and attachment to place.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
However, politics, economics, ideology, law, and some other so-called “human civilization” become reasons to prevent human uniting together. Is everyone really equal speaking of Climate?
\par
\texttt{“Climate mutation means that the question of the land on which we all stand has come back into focus, hence the general political disorientation, especially for the left, which did not expect to have to talk again of “people” and “soil” — questions mostly abandoned to the right.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
It is not the climate that splits us. The climate makes the separation into groups obvious. Although we are talking about the same thing, different phrasing can lead to different results. The antagonism floating on the top makes us too tired to discuss the real important things. The problem within contemporary society is that people refuse to join the discourse.
\par
\texttt{“The principle that will lead me in this reckoning is the link between the territory necessary for our subsistence and the territory that we recognize — legally, affectively — as our own and thus as the source of our freedom and autonomy.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
Latour mentions two territories, both of which are inhabitable. One is the productive space that keeps us alive. The other is the container for our daily activities in the form of data, part of which lies in Google's or Meta's giant data center. The non-material world does not exist without a physical carrier. The first territory is the place we stand, see and we touch. The second one is much more complicated because it was broken into pieces of a puzzle spreading everywhere. If we collect the pieces of a puzzle in the same physical site, and we try to assemble them, we will get a beast that represent our world but a distorted one. It sounds ridiculous, like finding a chipped fingernail and saying I found someone hiding here. But the reality is that we can indeed find the person through bioinformatics. 
\par
The digital footprints are even harder to eliminate. We have to pray that no one is stalking us and to pretend we are free people.
\par
\texttt{“the assumption that the present disorientation is due to the fabulous increase in the lack of fit between the two sets of constraints: we inhabit as citizens a land that is not the one we could subsist on, hence the increased feeling of homelessness, a feeling that is transforming the former ecological questions into a new set of more urgent and more tragic political struggles.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
Latour brings our attention to the concept of "citizenship" and politics. A lot of people are pessimistic about contemporary society because almost all non-binary problems will eventually turn into political issues. It is always the position instead of the rationality that gives the answer, even in an environment where everyone can use a pseudonym. Our position is limited by our vision. It was determined by origin, identity, education, and environment. Now let's put these advanced topics aside and talk a little bit about how to survive the brutal life adventure. Obviously, we have to be equipped with different philosophies and methods to survive in the two different lands. We should realize that emotion and knowledge are like the string connecting the two doppelgangers. The lifespan and the spirit are shared.~
\par
Different accounts mean different doppelgangers. The doppelgangers can represent the history and may have no relation to the present. I noticed the music recommendation by my 18's account was very different from my 20's account. Algorithms are defeated by fickle humans. Speaking of the internet world, we believe that internet friends can replace friends in the real life to some extent. Some of us put more effort into their accounts than tidying their rooms. It has no problem. I suddenly think of years before people are eager to see or date their internet friends in person. What kind of space do people need now? Shall we listen to our desire when we are designing the space? Who are we designing for?
\par
\texttt{“This is what Pierre Charbonnier calls the “ubiquity of the moderns” to underline that there is no correspondence whatsoever between the shape of nation states in the legal sense and the widely distributed sources of the wealth its citizens benefit from.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
It is irrelevant to the context. If being born in the United States means you are an American, can my digital doppelganger be an American? By the way, it was born on Google's servers in 2015.~
\par
The world is constructed according to the algorithm proposed by modernism. When world-building starts to go wrong, we are patching to correct off-tracks. I wonder is it still the same thing with too many patches?
\par
\texttt{“GLOBALIZATION is simultaneously that toward which the whole world is supposed to have progressed and a totally skewed utopian domain where time and space have been colonized to the point of rendering it uninhabitable and paralyzing any reaction to the threat everyone clearly sees coming.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 2)}
\par
Globalization always renders an optimistic mood. We see the world through a distorted lens. We empathize with capitalists as if we were rich, too. Like I sometimes cannot help teaching Americans how to spell English words.~
\par
\texttt{We are so arrogant that we ignore the crisis with peace of mind. Even if we want to react, we are held down by those around us, families, friends, etc.}
\par
\texttt{“It is different from the former precisely because it began to rematerialize all the elements that had been left aside, a bit too quickly, by those who had embarked on the great progressive movement toward globalization.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 2)}
\par
In my understanding, the Anthropocene is an addendum to globalization. The superposition of the Anthropocene and globalization will be the totality of our world.
\par
\texttt{“The key point is that it is not nature as such, whose immensity, indifference, aloofness, importance, and all-encompassing substance have always been celebrated, but an agent with its own force and power that requests to be integrated, in some way, into the political domain.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 2)}
\par
This sentence is confusing to me and seems to have a tendency to "make gods".
\par
In conjunction with the context that follows, Anthropocene is proposed in isolation from human history and attempts to abstract multiple subjectivity into one. I keep prudent towards that as a human being. It does not mean that it is undesirable to make grand narratives from the perspective of a non-human. One have to clarity their detached attitude at the beginning of their storytelling.
\par
\texttt{“freedom is for the few, not for the many; breaking from the limits of nature is the essential destiny of those few only”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
Everybody dreams to be the few. The modernism and globalization have their audience forever.
\par
As architects we should be aware that we are the accomplices of capital. We still have dream of fairness and justice. But we all know it is a fake glory for the sake of marketing and storytelling.
\par
\texttt{“On planet EXIT, the plan is that it will soon be possible to download our mortal bodies into a mix of robots, DNA, clouds, and AI, thereby situated as far as possible from the humble and limited Earth.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
Since humans no longer exist in human form, do we still need to treat them as the same species? Hidden behind EXIT is the bloodier issue of race and justice.
\par
The real world is complicated enough. Why should we bother to fictionalize the new world for discussion? Unless the real world has completely run out of territory.
\par
\texttt{“Wherever the gated community ends up being situated, the great difference between the planets GLOBALIZATION and EXIT is that there is no longer any project for the billions of humans who are explicitly now left behind or, to use a cruel but frank adjective, have become supernumerary.Civilization,in the narrow sense of a project invented in the eighteenth century, is now abandoned for good.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
Choosing Planet EXIT was a big gamble, betting that you would be one of the chosen few. This may be somehow equitable, whereby talent and wealth are determined at random, rather than from inheritance.
\par
Migration cannot solve issues but leave the issues behind. If the issues were as big as our planet, or the universe, we would have nowhere to hide.
\par
\texttt{“Where do the millions of people go? In one direction and one only: wherever they would like, so long as they remain behind walls, and thereby retain at least one element of the former civilizing project protection and identity.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
The wall and gravity are undoubtedly the two most important elements in Latour's essay. Walls provide sense of solidity and gravity provides sense of materiality. The texture of human beings is not supposed to be smooth, transparent and functional, but should be primitive, muddy and unpredictable.
\par
It seems like the superposition of the EXIT and SECURITY will be the totality of human beings.
\par
\texttt{“If prosperity and freedom are gone and it is impossible, as scientists insist, to bring prosperity and earthly conditions together, then let’s at least have an identity, a sense of belonging. Does it solve the problem of the superposition between subsistence, territory, and freedom?”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
If we ask what is the ideal built environment, it would be the one that can provide "subsistence, territory, and freedom" to its inhabitants.
\par
"subsistence, territory, and freedom" is the eternal pursuit of us Homo sapiens.
\par
\texttt{“let’s say the period from the sixteenth through eighteenth century, with its coal, and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with coal and oil.Economics was still an art of dealing with prudence and limits,and not yet with what could render as invisible the conditions of subsistence and infinitize profit. To use Timothy Mitchell’s thesis, they could not render invisible all links to earthly conditions.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 4)}
\par

This paragraph demonstrates the limitation of Anthropocene. Anthropocene can only be used to describe “here” and “now”. It is not for the past or future. It has no variation. It is static.

Interesting opinion. Advantage of thinking in perspective of Anthropocene.

\texttt{“Whenever people talk about modernization, they immediately create, by way of contrast, a primeval site, that of archaic attachment to the soil, to the ground, which is then either ridiculed as that from which the whole civilizing project has been extricating itself, or — what is even worse — celebrated as a mythical, archaic, primordial, autochthonous Ur-Earth free from all the tragic sins of civilized humans.”}\texttt{ }\emph{(Latour, 2018, p. 6)}

The problem of Modernism is that it is too smooth and abstract, and therefore prone to over-interpretation or misinterpretation. This is exactly the reason I wanted to trace back to the early modernism when I was planning the thesis.},

Surveying art history as well as the technologies of war and urban planning, Virilio provides us with an introduction to a new "logistics of the image". From the era of painting, engraving and architecture culminating in the 18th century, the history of "regimes of the visual" shifted with the intervention of the photogram (photography and cinematography) in the 19th century. The latest era starts with videography, holography and infographics, turning the dissolution of modernity into a generalised logic of public representations. Virilio's book offers the most provocative account of the history of "seeing" to date and could revolutionise the way we periodise not only art history but 'social existence' itself [Publisher description]},
