Arguing that the technical tools of design have often been flattened into the broader celebratory rhetoric of innovation, the volume editors and contributors seek to situate these tools on a broader epistemological canvas. How do these tools reflect architecture's changing relationship to evidence: from an emphasis on historical forms and traditions leading up to the 20th Century to a reliance on scientific and empirical data in the 21st. Organized around eight design techniques- rendering, scanning, modeling, controlling, specifying, networking, imaging, and lodging - this project blends discourses in architecture, media studies, history of technology and philosophy"--},

  abstract = {Electrifying, provocative, and controversial when first published thirty years ago, Donna Haraway’s “Cyborg Manifesto” is even more relevant today, when the divisions that she so eloquently challenges—of human and machine but also of gender, class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and location—are increasingly complex. The subsequent “Companion Species Manifesto,” which further questions the human–nonhuman disjunction, is no less urgently needed in our time of environmental crisis and profound polarization.Manifestly Haraway brings together these momentous manifestos to expose the continuity and ramifying force of Haraway’s thought, whose significance emerges with engaging immediacy in a sustained conversation between the author and her long-term friend and colleague Cary Wolfe. Reading cyborgs and companion species through and with each other, Haraway and Wolfe join in a wide-ranging exchange on the history and meaning of the manifestos in the context of biopolitics, feminism, Marxism, human–nonhuman relationships, making kin, literary tropes, material semiotics, the negative way of knowing, secular Catholicism, and more.The conversation ends by revealing the early stages of Haraway’s “Chthulucene Manifesto,” in tension with the teleologies of the doleful Anthropocene and the exterminationist Capitalocene. Deeply dedicated to a diverse and robust earthly flourishing, Manifestly Haraway promises to reignite needed discussion in and out of the academy about biologies, technologies, histories, and still possible futures.},

\par
\emph{“Today, geopolitics is also concerned with wars over the definition of the stage itself. A conflict will be called, from now on, “of planetary relevance” not because it has the planet for a stage, but because it is about which planet you are claiming to inhabit and defend.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
It is important to frame the field and clarify the definition before we start a conversation. It is crucial to read the information behind the written words when given a commission from a client to avoid trouble.
\par
\emph{“The climate question is not one aspect of politics among others, but that which defines the political order from beginning to end, forcing all of us to redefine the older questions of social justice along with those of identity, subsistence, and attachment to place.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
However, politics, economics, ideology, law, and some other so-called “human civilization” become reasons to prevent human uniting together. Is everyone really equal speaking of Climate?
\par
\emph{“Climate mutation means that the question of the land on which we all stand has come back into focus, hence the general political disorientation, especially for the left, which did not expect to have to talk again of “people” and “soil” — questions mostly abandoned to the right.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
It is not the climate that splits us. The climate makes the separation into groups obvious. Although we are talking about the same thing, different phrasing can lead to different results. The antagonism floating on the top makes us too tired to discuss the real important things. The problem within contemporary society is that people refuse to join the discourse.
\par
\emph{“The principle that will lead me in this reckoning is the link between the territory necessary for our subsistence and the territory that we recognize — legally, affectively — as our own and thus as the source of our freedom and autonomy.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
Latour mentions two territories, both of which are inhabitable. One is the productive space that keeps us alive. The other is the container for our daily activities in the form of data, part of which lies in Google's or Meta's giant data center. The non-material world does not exist without a physical carrier. The first territory is the place we stand, see and we touch. The second one is much more complicated because it was broken into pieces of a puzzle spreading everywhere. If we collect the pieces of a puzzle in the same physical site, and we try to assemble them, we will get a beast that represent our world but a distorted one. It sounds ridiculous, like finding a chipped fingernail and saying I found someone hiding here. But the reality is that we can indeed find the person through bioinformatics. 
\par
The digital footprints are even harder to eliminate. We have to pray that no one is stalking us and to pretend we are free people.
\par
\emph{“the assumption that the present disorientation is due to the fabulous increase in the lack of fit between the two sets of constraints: we inhabit as citizens a land that is not the one we could subsist on, hence the increased feeling of homelessness, a feeling that is transforming the former ecological questions into a new set of more urgent and more tragic political struggles.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
Latour brings our attention to the concept of "citizenship" and politics. A lot of people are pessimistic about contemporary society because almost all non-binary problems will eventually turn into political issues. It is always the position instead of the rationality that gives the answer, even in an environment where everyone can use a pseudonym. Our position is limited by our vision. It was determined by origin, identity, education, and environment. Now let's put these advanced topics aside and talk a little bit about how to survive the brutal life adventure. Obviously, we have to be equipped with different philosophies and methods to survive in the two different lands. We should realize that emotion and knowledge are like the string connecting the two doppelgangers. The lifespan and the spirit are shared.~
\par
Different accounts mean different doppelgangers. The doppelgangers can represent the history and may have no relation to the present. I noticed the music recommendation by my 18's account was very different from my 20's account. Algorithms are defeated by fickle humans. Speaking of the internet world, we believe that internet friends can replace friends in the real life to some extent. Some of us put more effort into their accounts than tidying their rooms. It has no problem. I suddenly think of years before people are eager to see or date their internet friends in person. What kind of space do people need now? Shall we listen to our desire when we are designing the space? Who are we designing for?
\par
\emph{“This is what Pierre Charbonnier calls the “ubiquity of the moderns” to underline that there is no correspondence whatsoever between the shape of nation states in the legal sense and the widely distributed sources of the wealth its citizens benefit from.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 1)}
\par
It is irrelevant to the context. If being born in the United States means you are an American, can my digital doppelganger be an American? By the way, it was born on Google's servers in 2015.~
\par
The world is constructed according to the algorithm proposed by modernism. When world-building starts to go wrong, we are patching to correct off-tracks. I wonder is it still the same thing with too many patches?
\par
\emph{“GLOBALIZATION is simultaneously that toward which the whole world is supposed to have progressed and a totally skewed utopian domain where time and space have been colonized to the point of rendering it uninhabitable and paralyzing any reaction to the threat everyone clearly sees coming.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 2)}
\par
Globalization always renders an optimistic mood. We see the world through a distorted lens. We empathize with capitalists as if we were rich, too. Like I sometimes cannot help teaching Americans how to spell English words.~
\par
We are so arrogant that we ignore the crisis with peace of mind. Even if we want to react, we are held down by those around us, families, friends, etc.
\par
\emph{“It is different from the former precisely because it began to rematerialize all the elements that had been left aside, a bit too quickly, by those who had embarked on the great progressive movement toward globalization.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 2)}
\par
In my understanding, the Anthropocene is an addendum to globalization. The superposition of the Anthropocene and globalization will be the totality of our world.
\par
\emph{“The key point is that it is not nature as such, whose immensity, indifference, aloofness, importance, and all-encompassing substance have always been celebrated, but an agent with its own force and power that requests to be integrated, in some way, into the political domain.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 2)}
\par
Latour's proposal puts Anthropocene on the same level as individuals.
\par
In conjunction with the context that follows, Anthropocene is proposed in isolation from human history and attempts to abstract multiple subjectivity into one. I keep prudent towards that as a human being. It does not mean that it is undesirable to make grand narratives from the perspective of a non-human. One have to clarity their detached attitude at the beginning of their storytelling.
\par
\emph{“freedom is for the few, not for the many; breaking from the limits of nature is the essential destiny of those few only”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
Everybody dreams to be the few. As architects, we should be aware that we are the accomplices of capital, though we sometimes claim that we are environmental agents.
\par
\emph{“On planet EXIT, the plan is that it will soon be possible to download our mortal bodies into a mix of robots, DNA, clouds, and AI, thereby situated as far as possible from the humble and limited Earth.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
If human beings no longer exist in human form, do we still need to treat them as the same species? Can Exit solve the problems we are facing? It reminds me of the Peasant Revolts they kill their king and become the new king. History will repeat itself if we keep a blind eye to the issues. The exit will make things even more difficult.
\par
\emph{“Wherever the gated community ends up being situated, the great difference between the planets GLOBALIZATION and EXIT is that there is no longer any project for the billions of humans who are explicitly now left behind or, to use a cruel but frank adjective, have become supernumerary.Civilization,in the narrow sense of a project invented in the eighteenth century, is now abandoned for good.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
Choosing Planet EXIT was a big gamble, betting that you would be one of the chosen few. Run-away cannot solve anything but makes things bigger. When the issue is as big as a planet, we have nowhere to hide.
\par
At that time, arguing about who is the best U.S. president becomes a funny scene.
\par
\emph{“Where do the millions of people go? In one direction and one only: wherever they would like, so long as they remain behind walls, and thereby retain at least one element of the former civilizing project protection and identity.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
Walls provide a sense of solidity. Gravity provides a sense of reality. Those who hide behind walls are not necessarily cowards. They are rational and a little conservative and believe they can find an image from history to deal with the dilemma right now. For some reason, they don't trust themselves. They need tons of references to support their courage. They are the majority, the indigenous people of globalization.
\par
\emph{“If prosperity and freedom are gone and it is impossible, as scientists insist, to bring prosperity and earthly conditions together, then let’s at least have an identity, a sense of belonging. Does it solve the problem of the superposition between subsistence, territory, and freedom?”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 3)}
\par
What is the dream habitat? Is there a place that satisfied the "subsistence, territory, and freedom" needs of its inhabitants?
\par
We voluntarily build walls to resist external risks. When we ourselves become a risk, we passively and voluntarily isolate ourselves. There exists an invisible wall of consciousness embedded in the culture, or even in the DNA. Human beings may bear to divide themselves.
\par
\emph{“let’s say the period from the sixteenth through eighteenth century, with its coal, and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with coal and oil.Economics was still an art of dealing with prudence and limits,and not yet with what could render as invisible the conditions of subsistence and infinitize profit. To use Timothy Mitchell’s thesis, they could not render invisible all links to earthly conditions.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 4)}
\par
The same is architecture.
\par
\emph{“You cannot insert into politics just any sort of natural entity without transforming the search for freedom and autonomy into the simple domination of necessity and heteronomy.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 6)}
\par
\emph{“the scales are correct, the influence indisputable, the effects devastating17 — is not something that any political agent can hear without ceasing to be a human political agent. In becoming geology, anthropocentric humans have become as immobile as pillars of salt.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 6)}
\par
Anthropocene is kind of static because it only describes "here" and "now" and has no relation to the past and future. That is its limitation. But still, a good model to perceive the situation.
\par
\emph{“The crucial discovery is that life forms don’t reside in space and time, but that time and space are the result of their own entanglement.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 6)}
\par
Yes. Time and space are concepts defined by humans. There used to be no digits in the world. When humans abstract the world into the digits, they possess a new world.
\par
\emph{“Whenever people talk about modernization, they immediately create, by way of contrast, a primeval site, that of archaic attachment to the soil, to the ground, which is then either ridiculed as that from which the whole civilizing project has been extricating itself, or — what is even worse — celebrated as a mythical, archaic, primordial, autochthonous Ur-Earth free from all the tragic sins of civilized humans.”}\emph{ (Latour, 2018, p. 6)}
\par
Modernism lacks a unified definition and description, which has led to future generations guessing to understand it, and therefore prone to over-interpret or misinterpret it. When we talk about modernism, what are we talking about? Modernism is not only a style.},

“The ‘world’, rather than something shared and understood, is plural, situated and in continuous formation.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
So as “we don’t seem to live in the same worlds”.

\end{itemize}

\par
“The observer here is understood as human or nonhuman/machine.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
We are so used to do nothing and be a witness. Detachment is one of the major themes of the contemporary life.

\end{itemize}

\par
“‘Objectivity is the subject’s delusion that observing can be done without him.’” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
This is a strong opinion statement that challenges the normative we constructed for the modernism. 

\end{itemize}

\par
“The certainty of all forms and their representations therefore are cast into doubt.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Truth is not important. We trust too much on the methodologies and precedents and tent to ignore the potential risks.

\end{itemize}

\par
“Architectural discourses today shy away from uncertainty and complexity.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
The designated ignorance on the changing context will finally lead into nihilism, causing an even deeper detachment to the reality. We are living in bubbles and never want to wake up. Perhaps the industry doesn’t need so many architects but we never know. Because we never ask.

\end{itemize}

\par
“The current lines of thought champion representational models of historical appropriation, dogmatic styles or an all-out rejection of architecture having meaningful social or political agency through design” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
What are we talking about when we talk about architecture? We believe we are problem solvers and scheme generators. However, people from other fields think we are horrible artists creating more and more trashes in the city, and causing trouble to people around them. 

\end{itemize}

\par
“Rather than illustrating ideas, models should offer us the possibility to engage and respond to the information-rich matrices that influence our everyday.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
“Model” is a projection of the past, a prediction for the future. “Model” can be biased.

\end{itemize}

\par
“Architecture must reconceptualise the role that space as medium can play today by rejecting the historical crutches that reinforce modern and postmodern rehashing.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 69)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Space is one of the most important attribute for being an architecture. It is irrelevant to the crisis human beings face like the hundreds ~of “-ism”s we generated during the past 100 years. 

\end{itemize}

\par
“‘Design then must be considered as durational, real-time and anticipatory exploring human with human, human with machine, and machine with machine communication.The challenge posed is how designers can construct environments that enable curiosity, evolve and allow for complex interactions to arise through human and nonhuman agency. Attention here is placed on behavioural features that afford conversational-rich exchanges between participants and systems, participants with other participants and/ or systems with other systems.This evolving framework demands that design systems have the capacity to participate and enable new forms of communication. Beyond convention architecture moves towards features that are life-like, machine learned, and emotively communicated.’” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 70)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
“real-time” is more a term for management and communication. It is hard to say it is good or not… Obviously it will make things more complicated. 

\end{itemize}

\par
“Architecture should foster intuitive and behavioural attributes of communication, giving agency to the collective through their action as influence.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 70)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
Architects need to be visual artists before they implement a project. Architects need to be influencers before they got a commission. Architects gain their money unnecessarily from a real project. Those facts are funny.

\end{itemize}

\par
“Architecture therefore needs to be an active participant moving beyond finite positions and passive observations towards a truly second-order cybernetic architecture that is both subject and interacting object within the world.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73)
\par
\begin{itemize}

\item 
How to do that? Through time, light, material…Through narratives and meanings people give to them…

\item 
However, 

\end{itemize}

\par
“Beyond simplistic relationships that reinforce passive observation, this approach enables each participant to be a performer actively influencing and being influenced within its environment.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73)
\par
“Beyond blueprint or masterplans, architecture today must argue for space as a medium of communication.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73)
\par
“Through enabling participation and affording agency we may find architecture must break its reliance on representation and notation and move towards the behavioural, offering an understanding of the deeper relationships between things.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73)
\par
“As technologies accelerate the collapse of space and time, architecture remains itself a form of resistance.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73)},

The miniature experience engages participants' proprioceptors and spatial memory, allowing them to orient themselves as they navigate a field of scattered video streams and localized sounds reproduced on a handheld computing device. Departing from one-way linear cinema played on a single rectangular screen, this multichannel virtual environment pursues a cinematic paradigm that undoes habitual ways of framing things, employing architectural concepts in a polylinear-video polyphonic-sound construction to create a kind of experience that lets the world reveal itself and permits discovery on the part of beholders. Interaction design for Walk-in Theater supports approaches to cinematic construction that employ the ambulatory, multiple and simultaneous viewpoints that humans exercise in everyday life.},

Surveying art history as well as the technologies of war and urban planning, Virilio provides us with an introduction to a new "logistics of the image". From the era of painting, engraving and architecture culminating in the 18th century, the history of "regimes of the visual" shifted with the intervention of the photogram (photography and cinematography) in the 19th century. The latest era starts with videography, holography and infographics, turning the dissolution of modernity into a generalised logic of public representations. Virilio's book offers the most provocative account of the history of "seeing" to date and could revolutionise the way we periodise not only art history but 'social existence' itself [Publisher description]},
