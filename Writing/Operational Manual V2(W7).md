## Quotes ##

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.
*(Klee, 1964, p.183)* [^1][^c]
Have no fear of perfection—you’ll never reach it.
*(Dalí, n.d.)*

## Position ##
Cloud is composed by the cultural production happening on digital platforms, structuring the new collective memory.
Stories are maps for system thinking and critical sites for operation.
Conversations are informal education among each other. 
Architecture is the art of assembling disparate images into new wholes/new worlds. Reality comes with the warning that no other version will be tolerated.
We are running naked in an unprecedented era.

**Release the Beasts**

*`Cavaguro, animal fantástico del Profesor Revillod, foto Óscar Alarcón para Neotraba (Alarcón, 2016)`* [^f][^2]

If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.
*(Wittgenstein, 1953)*[^3]

We have to recognise that only on the condition that we abandon the concept of the world can we possess the concept of a world.
*(Mark Cousins, 2021)*[^4]

---

This component is inspired by Prof. Revillod's Animanarium, which is originated for training imagination for fantasy stories and can best describe the strange familiarity we can feel about our digital age now.
The pursuit of rationality is important, but it is not the main purpose of this module. Therefore no more than 3 hours of adjustment time should be spent on individual individual adjustments after the generation of variants. Accept all the imperfections and move on.

*`An endless corridor leading people from Mordenism to Globalization with Anthropocene at left, Territory at right, Exit at the top, Security at the bottom, Contemporaneity within the hand `*| Ghost Author: MidJourney[^a] + Tarkovsky[^h]

This module aims to exam the ideas and assemble the spectacle world within a fast mode. The goal is to create a large number of objects via permutations and combinations in a short time and should not last for more than 4 weeks.
At this stage, we are going to invent new urban creatures derived from a set of archetypes at various scales by construction and deconstruction using some digital technics. These artificial creatures will be a blending of flesh(short), mechanics(long), and digits(eternal). These artifacts will be the heroines to participate in the story.
2D drawing is good. 3D modeling is awesome. Manual works in Rhino, Blender are accepted. Parametric programing is welcomed.
Don't be afraid of messy desktop. Fill the disk(c:) with unexpected byproducts. Even trash has its own meaning for existence. Trust the method. Keep writing logs.

**Building the Colosseum**

The model has been displaced as an image or object which imitates the designed object yet-to-be. In a sense everything becomes a potential model.
*(Mark Cousins, 2021)*

Digital optics is indeed a rational metaphor for intoxication, statistical intoxication, that is: a blurring of perception that affects the real as much as the figurative, as though our society were sinking into the darkness of a voluntary blindness, its will to digital power finally contaminating the horizon of sight as well as knowledge.
*(Paul Virilio, 1984, p.76)*[^5]

*`spiral staircase leading people from Mordenism to Globalization with Anthropocene at left, Territory at right, Exit at the top, Security at the bottom, Contemporaneity within the hand`* | Ghost Author: MidJourney[^a] + Tarkovsky[^h]

In this component, we start to think about the space where everything could happen. We are building stages to hold the artifacts from mission 01. Time, velocity and acceleration need to be taken into account. Scale and relation need to be clarified.
Remember to keep the idea simple and straightforward. Get rid of the branches and focus on the main storyline. Keep the chaos in order.

## Section 03 Mirrors Looking at Mirrors that Reflect Humans who Look at Mirrors ##
**Where is My Backup?**

![](https://lebbeuswoods.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/kies-vm-2a2.jpg)
 *`kiesler's drawings for vision study (1950)`*[^8][^i]

Architecture must re-conceptualize the role that space as medium can play today by rejecting the historical crutches that reinforce modern and postmodern rehashing...As technologies accelerate the collapse of space and time, architecture remains itself a form of resistance.
*(Theodore Spyropoulos, 2021, p.68)*[^7]

In the face of such representational open slather, the philosophical questions of plausibility and implausibility override those concerning the true and the false. The shift of interest from the thing to its image, and especially from space to time, to the instant, leads to a shift in polarities from the old black-and-white real-figurative dichotomy to the more relative actual-virtual.
*(Paul Virilio, 1984, p.70)*[^5]

*`a 18th circus show displaying fake memories, architects' toolsets, legs and arms of 21st century`* | Ghost Author: Midjourney[^a] + Tarkovsky[^h]

Point of view will be the key things for this section, so as the lens, fps, motion and colors. Shall we go to the mountain? Or let the mountain approach us?
Should it be a first-person or a third-person? Remember different audiences have different levels of background and knowledge base. Accessibility is as important as attracting the attention.
Struggles can be fun, such as the video game Resident Evil and Scorn. Have fun with these walking simulators!
We will start thinking about the final deliverables, a video(00:00:00), a miniature(x,y,z), a cylindrical time-space map(𝜌,𝜃,𝜁,𝜏)... Pick a good point for looping back. Differentiate the geometric time, labor time and tour time. Learn from short clips of concept art. Play with placeholders. Practice the philosophy of gray boxing and it's ok to remain non-object for sometime.

*`Screenshot from Nostalighia, 1983, Tarkovsky`*[^9]

The film [Stalker] needs to be slower and duller at the start so that the viewers who walked into the wrong theatre have time to leave before the main action starts.   
*(Andrei Tarkovsky, n.d.)*

You have to be a child—incidentally children understand my pictures very well, and I haven’t met a serious critic who could stand knee-high to those children. We think that art demands special knowledge; we demand some higher meaning from an author, but the work must act directly on our hearts or it has no meaning at all.
*(Andrei Tarkovsky, n.d.)*

But the model is not the world – to say the model is habitable does not mean we should go and live there. It is just a powerful way of seeing the world. 
*(Davies, 2021, p.37)*[^10]

The architectural model-fragment in its manifestation on the stage and in exhibition is a novel phenomenon of our time in that it performs the postdramatic maxim of the deliberately unfinished, the made and the constructed. 
*(Brejzek, Wallen, 2021, p.77)*[^11]

Time is embedded in materiality. How to show them?
Time is embedded in production. How to show them?
Time is embedded in narrative. How to show them?

We will focus on the time: solar time, labor time, media time, time stamps, time for seeing and time for thinking. How to differentiate the different velocities of decaying? How to bring the past into the future? When we shift between platforms, what is changed and what is not?

It is time to jump into post-production and stitch everything together. It is time to think about publication.

His practice included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design, photography, fashion and architecture at times in collaboration with other artists.

[^d]: - [Francisco Goya(1746-1828)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Goya) was a Spanish [romantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism "Romanticism") painter and printmaker.

We will focus on _[Stalker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalker_(1979_film))_ (1979) and _[Nostalghia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalghia "Nostalghia")_(1983) to learn time-space narrative and film composition.
