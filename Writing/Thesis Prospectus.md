## Prospectus ##
### Thesis Title ###
//By the Eye of the Cloud

### Thesis Abstract ###
//1-3 paragraphs
#### Problems and Significance####
- **Screens**, as a critical built environment, are **traps** for Homo sapiens. There is a missing of the discourse in our domain.  
- We occupy more **land** than we know. Part of our consciousness is in the form of gigabytes wandering in the open sea. Staging globalization - the new clarification of “territory” is badly needed.
- We are losing our **identity** as architects if we don’t have a clear and uniformed definition of “architecture” and “architect” in this digital age.
- Architects are in a very delicate position. We are aware of too much, however, the decision is not up to us.
- Software architects will be fired when a product has been 95% racked.
- No one cares about the **truth**. Or everyone has their own truth.
- **Architecture time** is slower than solar time, slower than the human history time.
- Architecture is a cluster of **visual stimuli**. It is like fashion but not fashion. After wandering around the visual “spectacles”, we realize our favorite is the non-object White on White.
- Architecture is a human-centered discipline although more and more people consider our age as Post-Anthropocene, and are more interested in thinking about **architecture of non-human**.
