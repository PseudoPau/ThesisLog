## Quotes ##

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee

‚ÄúHave no fear of perfection‚Äîyou‚Äôll never reach it.‚Äù*‚ÄìSalvador Dali

## Position ##


Thesis is considered the last opportunity to recap years of learning and to examine the discipline and the program as both a spectator and participant. We are the products waiting for quarantine before entering the market.

In terms of knowledge acquisition and application, architecture is similar to other disciplines: there is a significant detachment between frontier institutional research and real world practice. Therefore, the knowledge learned in school will likely be of little use in the practice, whereas the critical visual and verbal presentation skills as well as the legal and financial knowledge to succeed in design practice are not thoroughly taught as part of a curriculum, but as tacit knowledge that can only be learned from struggles and failures.

The thesis will firstly illustrate the complexity and diversity of the current techno-political and psycho-societal contexts by pieces of writing and drawing. The changes in the definition of architecture will be collated through literature review. An updated definition of architecture can be concluded by aligning with frontier neuroscience development as well as a comparison with sibling disciplines such as visual arts. Architects will be positioned as a looker being looked, and a creator being created. The overall purpose of the thesis is to re-clarify the scope of our practice and the range that we can control.

Project conduction will be synchronized with the writing of thesis. 

## Narrative ##

The project will fictionalize a spectacle adventure and an auction at the site of (00:00:00), (x,y,z) or (ùúå,ùúÉ,ùúÅ,ùúè). By portraying the formation, perception, distinction and interplay of the double self-images of the physical and the digital twins, the project indicates the technics, theories, aesthetics and values of the orthographic are universal to the ones in the digital age. The project aspires to bring spotlights to vision, screen and surface as significant elements to think of in thriving the built environment.

There exists a physical doppelganger inhabiting the "here and now" and a digital doppelganger inhabiting the cloud, who occupy different territories, have different appearances, sizes and lifespans, but share the same set of vision, perception and memory. The two worlds are segregated by a nameless, invisible, thick wall, with only a few neurons stitching together.

Assume one day the wall starts weathering. The physical doppelganger steps into the world of cloud and experiences several spectacles. They recognizes the mutilated digital one at an auction. Eventually they merge into one. The new individual possesses double territories with double vision.
