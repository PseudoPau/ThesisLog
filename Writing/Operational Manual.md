### Quotes ###

“Have no fear of perfection—you’ll never reach it.”*–Salvador Dali

"One eye sees, the other feels."*-Paul Klee

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee

## Project Narrative ##
The critical visual and verbal skills are not thoroughly taught in architecture schools as part of a curriculum, but as tacit knowledge that seems to be learned only from failures.
The project attempts to portray the essential toolkits to operate a successful design through a fictional auction, and then to suggest a supplementary curriculum to increase the excellence rate for the design education pipelines.

Architects and designers need to answer the following questions when they are preparing deliverables in order not to mess up a commission or a competition:
	1. Who is the audience?
	2. How to apportion the energy in design and representation?
	3. To what extent is a drawing considered presentable?
	4. What need to be highlighted?
For occasions that require roadshows with audiences of different levels of profession, teams might suffer from a deeper anxiety: 
	1. Who among the team would be the correct frontman?
	2. What need to be conveyed in the limited time of presentation?
	3. How to direct the audience's attention to the right spots?
	4. How to talk about a project?
