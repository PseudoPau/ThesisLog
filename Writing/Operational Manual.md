### Quotes ###

“Have no fear of perfection—you’ll never reach it.”*–Salvador Dali

"One eye sees, the other feels."*-Paul Klee

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee
