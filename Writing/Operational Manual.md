## Quotes ##

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee

‚ÄúHave no fear of perfection‚Äîyou‚Äôll never reach it.‚Äù*‚ÄìSalvador Dali

Thesis is considered the last opportunity to recap years of learning and to examine the discipline and the program as both a spectator and participant. We are the products waiting for quarantine before entering the market.

In terms of knowledge acquisition and application, architecture is similar to other disciplines: there is a significant detachment between frontier institutional research and real world practice. Therefore, the knowledge learned in school will likely be of little use in the practice, whereas the critical visual and verbal presentation skills as well as the legal and financial knowledge to succeed in design practice are not thoroughly taught as part of a curriculum, but as tacit knowledge that can only be learned from struggles and failures.

The thesis will firstly illustrate the complexity and diversity of the current techno-political and psycho-societal contexts by pieces of writing and drawing. The changes in the definition of architecture will be collated through literature review. An updated definition of architecture can be concluded by aligning with frontier neuroscience development as well as a comparison with sibling disciplines such as visual arts. Architects will be positioned as a looker being looked, and a creator being created. The overall purpose of the thesis is to re-clarify the scope of our practice and the range that we can control.

Project conduction will be synchronized with the writing of thesis. 

## Narrative ##

The project will fictionalize a spectacle adventure and an auction at the site of (00:00:00), (x,y,z) or (ùúå,ùúÉ,ùúÅ,ùúè). By portraying the formation, perception, distinction and interplay of the double self-images of the physical and the digital twins, the project indicates the technics, theories, aesthetics and values of the orthographic are universal to the ones in the digital age. The project aspires to bring spotlights to vision, screen and surface as significant elements to think of in thriving the built environment.

There exists a physical doppelganger inhabiting the "here and now" and a digital doppelganger inhabiting the cloud, who occupy different territories, have different appearances, sizes and lifespans, but share the same set of vision, perception and memory. The two worlds are segregated by a nameless, invisible, thick wall, with only a few neurons stitching together.

Assume one day the wall starts weathering. The physical doppelganger steps into the world of cloud and experiences several spectacles. They recognizes the mutilated digital one at an auction. Eventually they merge into one. The new individual possesses double territories with double vision.

If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.*Ludwig Wittgenstein*

We have to recognise that only on the condition that we abandon the concept of the world can we possess the concept of a world.*Mark Cousins*

---

This component is inspired by Prof. Revillod's Animanarium, which is originated for training imagination for fantasy stories, and Paul Klee's puppet.
In this stage, we are going to invent new urban creatures derived from a set of archetypes at various scales by construction and deconstruction using some digital technics. These artificial creatures will be partly flesh, partly mechanics, and partly digital. These non-existing artifacts will be the heroines for the Adventure, audience for the Auction, and part of the exhibition for the thesis review.



### Design Methods ###
**Automatism, Gestural Interpretation, Syntactical**

This module aims to exam the prompted definition and assemble the spectacle world within a fast mode. The goal is to create a large number of objects via permutations and combinations in a short time and should not last for more than 4 weeks.
The pursuit of rationality is important, but it is not the main purpose of this module. Therefore no more than 3 hours of adjustment time should be spent on individual individual adjustments after the generation of variants. Accept all the imperfections and move on.
2D drawing is good. 3D modeling is awesome. Manual works in Rhino, Blender are accepted. Parametric programing is welcomed.
Don't afraid of messy desktop and fill the disk(c:) with unexpected byproducts. Even trash has its own meaning for existence. Trust the method and keep writing logs. They will hold the logistics.

*`Interactive architectural dioramas in Unity, Damjan Jovanovic`*

The model has been displaced as an image or object which imitates the designed object yet-to-be. In a sense everything becomes a potential model.*Mark Cousins*

Architecture must re-conceptualize the role that space as medium can play today by rejecting the historical crutches that reinforce modern and postmodern rehashing...As technologies accelerate the collapse of space and time, architecture remains itself a form of resistance.*Theodore Spyropoulos*

### Design Methods ###
**Content to form, Diagramming, Narrative**

Start from the origin, (00:00:00), (x,y,z) or (ùúå,ùúÉ,ùúÅ,ùúè). Pick a good site for looping back. Create a glitch pattern and fill them with appropriate random contents. Or stay non-object.
