## Quotes ##

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee

‚ÄúHave no fear of perfection‚Äîyou‚Äôll never reach it.‚Äù*‚ÄìSalvador Dali

*Thesis* is considered the last opportunity to summarize years of learning, to both view and participate in the our discipline academically. We are the products waiting to enter the market after "quarantine".

Disciplinary speaking, architecture is similar to other disciplines that there is a significant detachment between institutional study and real-world practice. In other words, the knowledge learned in school will likely be of little use in the practice, while the critical visual, verbal, legal, and financial knowledge necessary to succeed in design practice is not adequately taught as part of a curriculum, but as tacit knowledge that can only be learned from struggles and failures. Who caused the situation? What can be improved?

An preliminary purpose of the thesis is to examine the external stimuli and internal response that we are exposed to in the process of learning architecture. 

What causes the separation between the academic and practice? Why do students always feel painful? What is the best method to publish our idea as architects? Whom are we presenting to? 

the complexity and diversity of the present socio-political and techno-political contexts through writing and drawing. Through a literature review, the change in the definition of architecture will be illustrated as part of the ambition. An alignment with other disciplines such as neuroscience, media, and visual art will be conducted as part of the scheme. Architects will be positioned as a looker being looked at, and a creator being created. The overall goal of the thesis is to re-clarify the scope of architectural practice and identify the elements that we can control.

Project conduction will be synchronized with the writing of thesis. 

## Narrative ##

The project will fictionalize a spectacle adventure and an auction at the site of (00:00:00), (x,y,z) or (ùúå,ùúÉ,ùúÅ,ùúè). By portraying the formation, perception, distinction and interplay of the double self-images of the physical and the digital twins, the project indicates the technics, theories, aesthetics and values of the orthographic are universal to the ones in the digital age. The project aspires to bring spotlights to vision, screen and surface as significant elements to think of in thriving the built environment.

There exists a physical doppelganger inhabiting the "here and now" and a digital doppelganger inhabiting the cloud, who occupy different territories, have different appearances, sizes and lifespans, but share the same set of vision, perception and memory. The two worlds are segregated by a nameless, invisible, thick wall, with only a few neurons stitching together.

Assume one day the wall starts weathering. The physical doppelganger steps into the world of cloud and experiences several spectacles. They recognizes the mutilated digital one at an auction. Eventually they merge into one. The new individual possesses double territories with double vision.

If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.*Ludwig Wittgenstein*

We have to recognise that only on the condition that we abandon the concept of the world can we possess the concept of a world.*Mark Cousins*

---

This component is inspired by Prof. Revillod's Animanarium, which is originated for training imagination for fantasy stories, and Paul Klee's puppet.
In this stage, we are going to invent new urban creatures derived from a set of archetypes at various scales by construction and deconstruction using some digital technics. These artificial creatures will be partly flesh, partly mechanics, and partly digital. These non-existing artifacts will be the heroines for the Adventure, audience for the Auction, and part of the exhibition for the thesis review.

This module aims to exam the prompted definition and assemble the spectacle world within a fast mode. The goal is to create a large number of objects via permutations and combinations in a short time and should not last for more than 4 weeks.
The pursuit of rationality is important, but it is not the main purpose of this module. Therefore no more than 3 hours of adjustment time should be spent on individual individual adjustments after the generation of variants. Accept all the imperfections and move on.
2D drawing is good. 3D modeling is awesome. Manual works in Rhino, Blender are accepted. Parametric programing is welcomed.
Don't afraid of messy desktop and fill the disk(c:) with unexpected byproducts. Even trash has its own meaning for existence. Trust the method and keep writing logs. They will hold the logistics.

The model has been displaced as an image or object which imitates the designed object yet-to-be. In a sense everything becomes a potential model.*Mark Cousins*

Digital optics is indeed a rational metaphor for intoxication, statistical intoxication, that is: a blurring of perception that affects the real as much as the figurative, as though our society were sinking into the darkness of a voluntary blindness, its will to digital power finally contaminating the horizon of sight as well as knowledge.*Paul Virilio*

In this component, we start to build scenes for audience to perceive, and wander around. Imagine that we are building a temple that houses the collective consciousness. Every architectural element will be granted a symbolic meaning. Architecture serves as a framework to host the artifacts from mission 01. Time, velocity and acceleration need to be taken into account. Motion is important. Relation need to be clarified.
But remember to keep the idea simple and straightforward. Get rid of the branches and only focus on the main line. Please keep the chaos in order.

## Mission 03 Continued Writing##
**a Chapter 6 for Virilio's Vision Machine**

 *`kiesler's drawings for vision study (1950)`*

Architecture must re-conceptualize the role that space as medium can play today by rejecting the historical crutches that reinforce modern and postmodern rehashing...As technologies accelerate the collapse of space and time, architecture remains itself a form of resistance.*Theodore Spyropoulos*

In the face of such representational open slather, the philosophical questions of plausibility and implausibility override those concerning the true and the false. The shift of interest from the thing to its image, and especially from space to time, to the instant, leads to a shift in polarities from the old black-and-white real-figurative dichotomy to the more relative actual-virtual.*Paul Virilio*

Point of view will be the key things, so as camera lens, frames per second, motion and light tones. In other words, we are designing for cameras, a mechanical vision.
Think about narrative seriously. Should it be a first-person or a third-person? Remember different audiences have different levels of background and knowledge base. Accessibility is as important as attracting the attention.
Struggles can be fun, such as the video game Resident Evil and Scorn. Have fun with these walking simulators!
We will start from the origin, (00:00:00), (x,y,z) or (ùúå,ùúÉ,ùúÅ,ùúè). Pick a good site for looping back. Differentiate the geometric time, labor time and tour time. Learn something from Stalker. Create a glitch pattern and fill them with appropriate random contents. Practice the philosophy of greyboxing and  it's ok to stay non-object for sometime.
