### Quotes ###

“Have no fear of perfection—you’ll never reach it.”*–Salvador Dali

"One eye sees, the other feels."*-Paul Klee

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee

## Project Narrative ##
Architects and designers need to answer the following questions when they are preparing deliverables in order not to mess up a commission or a competition:
	1. Who is the audience?
	2. How to apportion the energy in design and representation?
	3. To what extent is a drawing considered presentable?
	4. What need to be highlighted?
For occasions that require roadshows with audiences of different levels of profession, teams might suffer from a deeper anxiety: 
	1. Who among the team would be the correct frontman?
	2. What need to be conveyed in the limited time of presentation?
	3. How to direct the audience's attention to the right spots?
	4. How to talk about a project?
These critical visual and verbal skills are not taught in architecture schools as part of a curriculum, but as a tacit knowledge that seems to be learned only from failures, giving headaches to even the most gifted students.
The project tends to present the spectacle of architectural design and representation in the digital age by a fictional circus show.
