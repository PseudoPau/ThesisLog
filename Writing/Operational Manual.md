## Quotes ##

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.
*(Klee, 1964, p.183)* [^1][^c]
Have no fear of perfection‚Äîyou‚Äôll never reach it.
*(Dal√≠, n.d.)*

*Thesis* is considered the last opportunity to summarize years of learning, to both view and participate in the our discipline academically. We are the products waiting to enter the market after "quarantine".

Disciplinary speaking, architecture is similar to other disciplines that there is a significant detachment between institutional study and real-world practice. In other words, the knowledge learned in school will likely be of little use in the practice, while the critical visual, verbal, legal, and financial knowledge necessary to succeed in design practice is not adequately taught as part of a curriculum, but as tacit knowledge that can only be learned from struggles and failures. Who caused the situation? What makes our learning so painful as an ordeal?

We have reasons to suspect that architecture is not a self-sufficient discipline. There was little left on our curriculum once we stripped out courses that were appropriated from other disciplines. As a result, architecture students have a broader scope of focus and a more hairy skill tree than their peers. However, our outputs (built or unbuilt building projects) is too homogeneous compared to those continuous multi-form inputs. Are we lacking imagination? Why are we voluntarily bound to the narrow territory of practice? Thus new questions arise: what is an appropriate way to publish an architectural idea? What is architecture?

An preliminary purpose of the thesis is to align our discipline with the contemporary context. Then the external stimuli to which we are exposed and the internal responses that arise during the learning of architecture will be examined.

The ontology of architecture is difficult to identify. But this does not mean that the discipline itself is void. In this case, I would rather believe that architecture is a monument to energy and time, a physical projection of the immaterial world, a intersection of several other disciplines, or a cabinet of curiosity that encompasses everything.

Project conduction will be synchronized with the writing of thesis.



## Narrative ##

*The project* will fictionalize a spectacle adventure at the site (00:00:00), an auction at the site of (x,y,z), and a cloud at the site of  (ùúå,ùúÉ,ùúÅ,ùúè). 

The project will tell the adventure of a physical doppelganger who escapes the trap of culture and finds their digital doppelganger to merge into a complete individual who occupies the double space and has a double vision.

By portraying the formation, perception, distinction and interplay of the double self-images of the physical and the digital twins, the project indicates the technics, theories, aesthetics and values of the orthographic are universal to the ones in the digital age. The project aspires to bring spotlights to vision, screen and surface as significant elements to think of in thriving the built environment.

*`a physical doppelganger looking at his digital doppelganger through a weathering mirror`* | Ghost Author: MidJourney[^a] + Gustav Klimt[^e]

The physical doppelganger originally inhabits the "here and now" and the digital doppelganger inhabits the cloud. The two twins don't realize the existence of each other at the beginning of the story. They occupy different territories, have different appearances, sizes and lifespans, but share the same set of vision, perception and memory. and are segregated by an untitled invisible thick wall, with only a few neurons connecting both side. Walls can be interpreted as somewhat culture. The wall will weather, diverge, iterate itself and fall someday. When the physical doppelganger leave the "here and now" and steps into the world of cloud, they will experience spectacles as a looker and being looked-at at one time. When the two doppelgangers merge into one, the new individual possesses double territories with double vision.

## Mission 01 Bestiario##
**Eyes Wide Open, Creating Beasts**

If a lion could talk, we could not understand him.
*(Wittgenstein, 1953)*[^3]

We have to recognise that only on the condition that we abandon the concept of the world can we possess the concept of a world.
*(Mark Cousins, 2021)*[^4]

---

This component is inspired by Prof. Revillod's Animanarium, which is originated for training imagination for fantasy stories.
At this stage, we are going to invent new urban creatures derived from a set of archetypes at various scales by construction and deconstruction using some digital technics. These artificial creatures will be a blending of flesh(short life), mechanics(long life), and digital(eternal life). These artifacts will be the heroines to participate in the story.

This module aims to exam the ideas and assemble the spectacle world within a fast mode. The goal is to create a large number of objects via permutations and combinations in a short time and should not last for more than 4 weeks.
The pursuit of rationality is important, but it is not the main purpose of this module. Therefore no more than 3 hours of adjustment time should be spent on individual individual adjustments after the generation of variants. Accept all the imperfections and move on.
2D drawing is good. 3D modeling is awesome. Manual works in Rhino, Blender are accepted. Parametric programing is welcomed.
Don't afraid of messy desktop and fill the disk(c:) with unexpected byproducts. Even trash has its own meaning for existence. Trust the method and keep writing logs. They will hold the logistics.

The model has been displaced as an image or object which imitates the designed object yet-to-be. In a sense everything becomes a potential model.
*(Mark Cousins, 2021)*

Digital optics is indeed a rational metaphor for intoxication, statistical intoxication, that is: a blurring of perception that affects the real as much as the figurative, as though our society were sinking into the darkness of a voluntary blindness, its will to digital power finally contaminating the horizon of sight as well as knowledge.

In this component, we start to build scenes for audience to perceive, and wander around. Imagine that we are building a temple that houses the collective consciousness. Every architectural element will be granted a symbolic meaning. Architecture serves as a framework to host the artifacts from mission 01. Time, velocity and acceleration need to be taken into account. Motion is important. Relation need to be clarified.
But remember to keep the idea simple and straightforward. Get rid of the branches and only focus on the main line. Please keep the chaos in order.

## Mission 03 Furnishing the Quarry ##
**a Continued Writing for Vision Machine (Virilio, 1984), Academic Ambition**

![](https://lebbeuswoods.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/kies-vm-2a2.jpg)
 *`kiesler's drawings for vision study (1950)`*[^8][^i]

Architecture must re-conceptualize the role that space as medium can play today by rejecting the historical crutches that reinforce modern and postmodern rehashing...As technologies accelerate the collapse of space and time, architecture remains itself a form of resistance.
*(Theodore Spyropoulos, 2021, p.68)*[^7]

In the face of such representational open slather, the philosophical questions of plausibility and implausibility override those concerning the true and the false. The shift of interest from the thing to its image, and especially from space to time, to the instant, leads to a shift in polarities from the old black-and-white real-figurative dichotomy to the more relative actual-virtual.

Point of view will be the key things, so as camera lens, frames per second, motion and light tones. In other words, we are designing for cameras, a mechanical vision.
Think about narrative seriously. Should it be a first-person or a third-person? Remember different audiences have different levels of background and knowledge base. Accessibility is as important as attracting the attention.
Struggles can be fun, such as the video game Resident Evil and Scorn. Have fun with these walking simulators!
We will start from the origin, (00:00:00), (x,y,z) or (ùúå,ùúÉ,ùúÅ,ùúè). Pick a good site for looping back. Differentiate the geometric time, labor time and tour time. Learn something from Stalker. Create a glitch pattern and fill them with appropriate random contents. Practice the philosophy of greyboxing and  it's ok to stay non-object for sometime.

It is time to jump into post-production and stitch everything together. This component we will focus on the time: solar time, labor time, media time, time stamps, time for seeing and time for thinking. How to differentiate the different velocities of decaying? Should we bring the past into the future? When we shift between platforms, what is changed and what is not?
	Time is embedded in materiality. How to show them?
	Time is embedded in production. How to show them?
	Time is embedded in narrative. How to show them?

It is time to wrap things up and come up with a good stage set for displaying. Who is the audience? What kind of fire would you like to set up? What should be shown and what should not? How to verbalize what you did in the past months?
To publish your world. To engage others.
