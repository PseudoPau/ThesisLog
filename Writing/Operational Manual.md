### Quotes ###

“Have no fear of perfection—you’ll never reach it.”*–Salvador Dali

"One eye sees, the other feels."*-Paul Klee

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee

## Project Narrative ##

Thesis is considered the last opportunity to recap years of learning and to examine the discipline and the program as both a spectator and participant.

The critical visual and verbal presentation skills as well as the legal and financial knowledge to succeed in design practice are not thoroughly taught as part of a curriculum, but as tacit knowledge that can only be learned from struggles and failures.

The project attempts to portray the imperfect design education outcomes and the supplementary toolkits to operate a successful real world project through a fictional auction.

The thesis project will firstly illustrate the complexity and diversity of the current technopolitical and psychosocietial contexts by pieces of writing and drawing. A new definition of architecture can be concluded by aligning with frontier neuroscience development as well as a comparison with sibling disciplines such as visual arts. The project will also situate architects as a looker and a perceiver, in an attempt to redefine the scope of their skills and competence.
