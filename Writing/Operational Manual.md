### Quotes ###

“Have no fear of perfection—you’ll never reach it.”*–Salvador Dali

"One eye sees, the other feels."*-Paul Klee

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee

## Project Narrative ##

Thesis is considered the last opportunity to recap years of learning and to examine the discipline and the program as both a spectator and participant.

In terms of knowledge acquisition and application, architecture is similar to other disciplines: there is a significant detachment between frontier institutional research and real world practice. Therefore, the knowledge learned in school will likely be of little use in the practice, whereas the critical visual and verbal presentation skills as well as the legal and financial knowledge to succeed in design practice are not thoroughly taught as part of a curriculum, but as tacit knowledge that can only be learned from struggles and failures.

The thesis will firstly illustrate the complexity and diversity of the current techno-political and psycho-societal contexts by pieces of writing and drawing. An updated definition of architecture can be concluded by aligning with frontier neuroscience development as well as a comparison with sibling disciplines such as visual arts. Architects will be positioned as a looker and perceiver. The overall purpose of the thesis is to re-clarify the scope of our practice and the range that we can control.

Project conduction will be synchronized with the writing of thesis. The project will attempt to portray the imperfect design education outcomes and the supplementary toolkits to operate a successful real world project through a fictional auction.
