**A Fictional Circus Show**

### Quotes ###

“Have no fear of perfection—you’ll never reach it.”*–Salvador Dali

"One eye sees, the other feels."*-Paul Klee

In the final analysis, a drawing simply is no longer a drawing, no matter how self-sufficient its execution may be. It is a symbol, and the more profoundly the imaginary lines of projection meet higher dimensions, the better.*-Paul Klee

## Project Narrative ##
Architects and designers are facing problems when they are preparing a set of deliverables for a commission or a competition. 
	1. Who is the audience to please?
	2. How to apportion the energy in design and representation?
	3. To what extent is a drawing considered presentable for others to see?

The project tends to present the spectacle of architectural design and representation in the digital age by a fictional circus show.
