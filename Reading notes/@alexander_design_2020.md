##Abstract
---
"This edited collection seeks to historicize and theorize technology's role in architectural design. Arguing that the technical tools of design have often been flattened into the broader celebratory rhetoric of innovation, the volume editors and contributors seek to situate these tools on a broader epistemological canvas. How do these tools reflect architecture's changing relationship to evidence: from an emphasis on historical forms and traditions leading up to the 20th Century to a reliance on scientific and empirical data in the 21st. Organized around eight design techniques- rendering, scanning, modeling, controlling, specifying, networking, imaging, and lodging - this project blends discourses in architecture, media studies, history of technology and philosophy"â€“
