`“Today, geopolitics is also concerned with wars over the definition of the stage itself. A conflict will be called, from now on, “of planetary relevance” not because it has the planet for a stage, but because it is about which planet you are claiming to inhabit and defend.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 1)

It is important to frame the field and clarify the definition before we start a conversation in the fluid contemporary context. It is crucial to read the information behind the written words when given a commission from a client.

`“The climate question is not one aspect of politics among others, but that which defines the political order from beginning to end, forcing all of us to redefine the older questions of social justice along with those of identity, subsistence, and attachment to place.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 1)

However, politics, economics, ideology, law and some other so-called “pearls of human civilization” become reasons to prevent human uniting together. Is everyone really equal speaking of Climate?

`“Climate mutation means that the question of the land on which we all stand has come back into focus, hence the general political disorientation, especially for the left, which did not expect to have to talk again of “people” and “soil” — questions mostly abandoned to the right.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 1)

All human conflicts can be ascribed to the land. If we think of climate and environment as a resource or an innate advantage/disadvantage of development, we can understand why conflicts or compromises exist in the "here" and "now".

What are we designing for? Our research focuses on  "here" and "now", but our users are in the future. We can get a prediction or several predictions from trained AI models, but they cannot represent the future by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

`“The principle that will lead me in this reckoning is the link between the territory necessary for our subsistence and the territory that we recognize — legally, affectively — as our own and thus as the source of our freedom and autonomy.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 1)

Latour mentions two territories, both of which are inhabitable. One is the productive space that is physical, touchable and keeps us alive. The other is more like an immaterial territory of consciousness existing in nowhere or everywhere. Let’s make another assumption that it is a territory on the Cloud, inhabitable as well, only provides advanced survival needs beyond “safety” in Maslow's hierachy.

Here we know everyone processes two territories that overlap each other. The areas of the territories are not fixed. They can grow as the owner’s perception grows, or shrinks through interpersonal confrontations.

`“the assumption that the present disorientation is due to the fabulous increase in the lack of fit between the two sets of constraints: we inhabit as citizens a land that is not the one we could subsist on, hence the increased feeling of homelessness, a feeling that is transforming the former ecological questions into a new set of more urgent and more tragic political struggles.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 1)

We are equipped with different philosophies and methods to survive in the two different tanks. Emotion and knowledge are like the string connecting the two doppelgangers.

There is no doubt that the wounds we get in the physical world need to be healed in a physical clinic. How about the damages from another world?

`“This is what Pierre Charbonnier calls the “ubiquity of the moderns” to underline that there is no correspondence whatsoever between the shape of nation states in the legal sense and the widely distributed sources of the wealth its citizens benefit from.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 1)

Climate can't unite humans. Neither can politics. Religious works for sometimes however cause some side effect at the meantime. How about capital? While there have always been critiques about capital and globalization, we have to admit that capital is, at least so far, the only merit that succeeded in binding human beings together. We cannot afford de-globalization.

As a civilized modern people we cannot avoid questions about citizenship. How to define citizenship? If paying taxes means being a citizen, can we consider a company as a citizen? Are citizenship important for juristic persons like companies? How does capital view citizenship?

`“GLOBALIZATION is simultaneously that toward which the whole world is supposed to have progressed and a totally skewed utopian domain where time and space have been colonized to the point of rendering it uninhabitable and paralyzing any reaction to the threat everyone clearly sees coming.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 2)

It is true that globalization always renders an optimistic mood. Human’s nerves of pain and awareness of crisis have receded like never before. In the contrary, some trivial panic is blown into magnification, diverting everyone's attention away from the real crisis. This has created the spectacle that Musk's tweets attracting more attention than the increasing rent and food prices in our life. This phenomenon also reflects the increase of the unspeakable in human history. We tend to play deaf and practice Wittgenstein's "whatever cannot be said, be silent".

There is a possibility that the area of world is still sufficient, but more places turns to be inaccessible for some reason, as toxins are everywhere, walls are everywhere, surveillance is everywhere...

`“It is different from the former precisely because it began to rematerialize all the elements that had been left aside, a bit too quickly, by those who had embarked on the great progressive movement toward globalization.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 2)

IIn my understanding, the Anthropocene is an addendum to globalization. The superposition of the Anthropocene and globalization will be the totality of our world.

`“The key point is that it is not nature as such, whose immensity, indifference, aloofness, importance, and all-encompassing substance have always been celebrated, but an agent with its own force and power that requests to be integrated, in some way, into the political domain.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 2)

This sentence is confusing to me and seems to have a tendency to "make gods".

In conjunction with the context that follows, Anthropocene is proposed in isolation from human history and attempts to abstract multiple subjectivity into one. I keep prudent towards that as a human being. It does not mean that it is undesirable to make grand narratives from the perspective of a non-human. One have to clarity their detached attitude at the beginning of their storytelling.

`“freedom is for the few, not for the many; breaking from the limits of nature is the essential destiny of those few only”` (Latour, 2018, p. 3)

Everybody dreams to be the few. The modernism and globalization have their audience forever.

As architects we should be aware that we are the accomplices of capital. We still have dream of fairness and justice. But we all know it is a fake glory for the sake of marketing and storytelling.

`“On planet EXIT, the plan is that it will soon be possible to download our mortal bodies into a mix of robots, DNA, clouds, and AI, thereby situated as far as possible from the humble and limited Earth.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 3)

Since humans no longer exist in human form, do we still need to treat them as the same species? Hidden behind EXIT is the bloodier issue of race and justice.

The real world is complicated enough. Why should we bother to fictionalize the new world for discussion? Unless the real world has completely run out of territory.

`“Wherever the gated community ends up being situated, the great difference between the planets GLOBALIZATION and EXIT is that there is no longer any project for the billions of humans who are explicitly now left behind or, to use a cruel but frank adjective, have become supernumerary.Civilization,in the narrow sense of a project invented in the eighteenth century, is now abandoned for good.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 3)

Choosing Planet EXIT was a big gamble, betting that you would be one of the chosen few. This may be somehow equitable, whereby talent and wealth are determined at random, rather than from inheritance.

Migration cannot solve issues but leave the issues behind. If the issues were as big as our planet, or the universe, we would have nowhere to hide.

`“Where do the millions of people go? In one direction and one only: wherever they would like, so long as they remain behind walls, and thereby retain at least one element of the former civilizing project protection and identity.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 3)

The wall and gravity are undoubtedly the two most important elements in Latour's essay. Walls provide sense of solidity and gravity provides sense of materiality. The texture of human beings is not supposed to be smooth, transparent and functional, but should be primitive, muddy and unpredictable.

It seems like the superposition of the EXIT and SECURITY will be the totality of human beings.

`“If prosperity and freedom are gone and it is impossible, as scientists insist, to bring prosperity and earthly conditions together, then let’s at least have an identity, a sense of belonging. Does it solve the problem of the superposition between subsistence, territory, and freedom?”` (Latour, 2018, p. 3)

If we ask what is the ideal built environment, it would be the one that can provide "subsistence, territory, and freedom" to its inhabitants.

"subsistence, territory, and freedom" is the eternal pursuit of us Homo sapiens.

`“let’s say the period from the sixteenth through eighteenth century, with its coal, and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with coal and oil.Economics was still an art of dealing with prudence and limits,and not yet with what could render as invisible the conditions of subsistence and infinitize profit. To use Timothy Mitchell’s thesis, they could not render invisible all links to earthly conditions.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 4)

The same is architecture.

`“You cannot insert into politics just any sort of natural entity without transforming the search for freedom and autonomy into the simple domination of necessity and heteronomy.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 6)

`“the scales are correct, the influence indisputable, the effects devastating17 — is not something that any political agent can hear without ceasing to be a human political agent. In becoming geology, anthropocentric humans have become as immobile as pillars of salt.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 6)

This paragraph demonstrates the limitation of Anthropocene. Anthropocene can only be used to describe “here” and “now”. It is not for the past or future. It has no variation. It is static.

`“The crucial discovery is that life forms don’t reside in space and time, but that time and space are the result of their own entanglement.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 6)

Interesting opinion. Advantage of thinking in perspective of Anthropocene.

`“Whenever people talk about modernization, they immediately create, by way of contrast, a primeval site, that of archaic attachment to the soil, to the ground, which is then either ridiculed as that from which the whole civilizing project has been extricating itself, or — what is even worse — celebrated as a mythical, archaic, primordial, autochthonous Ur-Earth free from all the tragic sins of civilized humans.”` (Latour, 2018, p. 6)

The problem of Modernism is that it is too smooth and abstract, and therefore prone to over-interpretation or misinterpretation. This is exactly the reason I wanted to trace back to the early modernism when I was planning the thesis.
