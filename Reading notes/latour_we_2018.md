`“Today, geopolitics is also concerned with wars over the definition of the stage itself. A conflict will be called, from now on, “of planetary relevance” not because it has the planet for a stage, but because it is about which planet you are claiming to inhabit and defend.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 1)*

   It is important to frame the field and clarify the definition before we start a conversation. It is crucial to read the information behind the written words when given a commission from a client to avoid trouble.

`“The climate question is not one aspect of politics among others, but that which defines the political order from beginning to end, forcing all of us to redefine the older questions of social justice along with those of identity, subsistence, and attachment to place.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 1)*

   However, politics, economics, ideology, law and some other so-called “human civilization” become reasons to prevent human uniting together. Is everyone really equal speaking of Climate?

`“Climate mutation means that the question of the land on which we all stand has come back into focus, hence the general political disorientation, especially for the left, which did not expect to have to talk again of “people” and “soil” — questions mostly abandoned to the right.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 1)*

   It is not climate that splits us. Climate makes the separation in groups obvious. Although we are talking about the same thing, different phrasing can lead to different results. The antagonism floating on the top makes us too tired to discuss the real important things. The problem within the contemporary society is that people refuse to join the discourse.

`“The principle that will lead me in this reckoning is the link between the territory necessary for our subsistence and the territory that we recognize — legally, affectively — as our own and thus as the source of our freedom and autonomy.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 1)*

   Latour mentions two territories, both of which are inhabitable. One is the productive space that keeps us alive. The other is the container for our daily activities in the form of data, part of which lies in the Google's or Meta's giant data center. The non-material world does not exist without a physical carrier. The first territory is the place we stand, we see and we touch. The second one is much more complicated because it was broken into pieces of puzzle spreading everywhere.
   If we collect the pieces of puzzle in the same physical site, and we try to assemble them, we will get a beast which can represent our world but a distorted one. It sounds ridiculous, like finding a chipped fingernail and saying I found someone hiding here. But the reality is that we can indeed find the person through bioinformatics... 
   The digital footprints are even harder to eliminate. We have to pray that no one is stalking us and to pretend we are free people.

`“the assumption that the present disorientation is due to the fabulous increase in the lack of fit between the two sets of constraints: we inhabit as citizens a land that is not the one we could subsist on, hence the increased feeling of homelessness, a feeling that is transforming the former ecological questions into a new set of more urgent and more tragic political struggles.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 1)*

   Latour brings our attentions to the concept of "citizenship" and politics. A lot of people are pessimistic about the contemporary society because almost all non-binary problems will eventually turned into a politic issues. It is always the position instead of the rationality that gives the answer, even in an environment where everyone can use a pseudonym. Our position is limited by our vision. It was determined by origin, identity, education and environment.
   Now let's put these advanced topics aside and talk a little bit about how to survive the brutal life adventure. Obviously, we have to equipped with different philosophies and methods to survive in the two different lands. We should realize the emotion and knowledge are like the string connecting the two doppelgangers. The lifespan and the spirit are shared.
   Different accounts means different doppelgangers. The doppelgangers can represent a history and may have no relation to the present. I noticed the music recommendation by my 18's account was very different from my 20's account. Algorithms are defeated by fickle humans.
   Speaking of the internet world, we believe the internet friends can replace the friends in the real life to some extent. Some of us put more effort into their accounts than tidying their rooms. It has no problem. I suddenly think of years before people are eager to see or date their internet friends in person. What kind of space do people need now? Shall we listen to our desire when we are designing the space? Who are we designing for?

`“This is what Pierre Charbonnier calls the “ubiquity of the moderns” to underline that there is no correspondence whatsoever between the shape of nation states in the legal sense and the widely distributed sources of the wealth its citizens benefit from.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 1)*

   It is irrelevant to the context. If being born in the United States means you are an American, can my digital doppelganger be an American? By the way, it was born in Google's servers in 2015.
   The world is constructed according to the algorithm proposed by modernism. When the world building starts to go wrong, we are patching to correct off-tracks. I wonder is it still the same thing with too many patches?

`“GLOBALIZATION is simultaneously that toward which the whole world is supposed to have progressed and a totally skewed utopian domain where time and space have been colonized to the point of rendering it uninhabitable and paralyzing any reaction to the threat everyone clearly sees coming.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 2)*

   Globalization always renders an optimistic mood. We see the world through distorted lens. We empathize with capitalists as if we were rich, too. Like I sometimes cannot help teaching Americans how to spell English worlds...
   We are so arrogant that we ignore the crisis with peace of mind. Even we want to react, we are held down by those around us, families, friends, etc.

`“It is different from the former precisely because it began to rematerialize all the elements that had been left aside, a bit too quickly, by those who had embarked on the great progressive movement toward globalization.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 2)*

   Anthropocene is an addendum to Globalization. They are in figure-ground relation. When we discuss Anthropocene, we must be aware that we are also talking about Globalization. They are shadows to each others.

`“The key point is that it is not nature as such, whose immensity, indifference, aloofness, importance, and all-encompassing substance have always been celebrated, but an agent with its own force and power that requests to be integrated, in some way, into the political domain.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 2)*

   I don't know if it is reasonable to discuss human beings as if we are not human beings. Latour's proposal puts Anthropocene to the same level as individuals.

`“freedom is for the few, not for the many; breaking from the limits of nature is the essential destiny of those few only”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 3)*

   Everybody dreams to be the few.

   As architects we should be aware that we are the accomplices of capital, though we sometimes claim that we are environmental agents. 

`“On planet EXIT, the plan is that it will soon be possible to download our mortal bodies into a mix of robots, DNA, clouds, and AI, thereby situated as far as possible from the humble and limited Earth.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 3)*

   If human beings no longer exist in human form, do we still need to treat them as the same species? Can Exit solve the problems we are facing? It reminds me of the Peasant Revolts that they kill their king and become the new king. The history will repeat itself if we keep a blind eye to the issues. Exit will make things even more difficult.

`“Wherever the gated community ends up being situated, the great difference between the planets GLOBALIZATION and EXIT is that there is no longer any project for the billions of humans who are explicitly now left behind or, to use a cruel but frank adjective, have become supernumerary.Civilization,in the narrow sense of a project invented in the eighteenth century, is now abandoned for good.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 3)*

   Choosing Planet EXIT was a big gamble, betting that you would be one of the chosen few. Run-away cannot solve anything but makes things bigger. When the issue is as big as a planet, we have nowhere to hide. At that time, arguing who is the best U.S president becomes a funny scene.

`“Where do the millions of people go? In one direction and one only: wherever they would like, so long as they remain behind walls, and thereby retain at least one element of the former civilizing project protection and identity.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 3)*

   Walls provide sense of solidity. Gravity provides sense of reality. Those who hide behind walls are not necessarily cowards. They are rational and a little conservative and believe they can find an image from the history to deal with the dilemma right now. For some reasons, they don't trust themselves. They need tons of reference to support their courage. They are the majority, the indigenous people of globalization.

`“If prosperity and freedom are gone and it is impossible, as scientists insist, to bring prosperity and earthly conditions together, then let’s at least have an identity, a sense of belonging. Does it solve the problem of the superposition between subsistence, territory, and freedom?”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 3)*

   What is the dream habitat? Is there a place satisfied  "subsistence, territory, and freedom" needs for its inhabitants?
   We voluntarily build walls to resist external risks. When we ourselves become a risk, we passively and voluntarily isolate ourselves. There exists an invisible wall of consciousness embedded in the culture, or even in the DNA. Human beings may born to divide themselves.

`“let’s say the period from the sixteenth through eighteenth century, with its coal, and the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with coal and oil.Economics was still an art of dealing with prudence and limits,and not yet with what could render as invisible the conditions of subsistence and infinitize profit. To use Timothy Mitchell’s thesis, they could not render invisible all links to earthly conditions.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 4)*

   Noise, dirts and bad elements are also parts of the world. The imperfect is the real.

`“You cannot insert into politics just any sort of natural entity without transforming the search for freedom and autonomy into the simple domination of necessity and heteronomy.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 6)*

`“the scales are correct, the influence indisputable, the effects devastating17 — is not something that any political agent can hear without ceasing to be a human political agent. In becoming geology, anthropocentric humans have become as immobile as pillars of salt.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 6)*

   Anthropocene is kind of static because it only describes "here" and "now" and has no relation to past and future. That is its limitation. But still a good model to perceive the situation.

`“The crucial discovery is that life forms don’t reside in space and time, but that time and space are the result of their own entanglement.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 6)*

   Yes. Time and space are concepts defined by humans.There used to be no digits in the world. When humans abstract the world into the digits, they possess a new world.

`“Whenever people talk about modernization, they immediately create, by way of contrast, a primeval site, that of archaic attachment to the soil, to the ground, which is then either ridiculed as that from which the whole civilizing project has been extricating itself, or — what is even worse — celebrated as a mythical, archaic, primordial, autochthonous Ur-Earth free from all the tragic sins of civilized humans.”` *(Latour, 2018, p. 6)*

   Modernism lacks a unified definition and description, which has led to future generations guessing to understand it, and therefore prone to over-interpret or mis-interpret it. When we talk about modernism, what are we talking about? Modernism is not only a style...
