It is important to frame the field and clarify the definition before we start a conversation. It is crucial to read the information behind the written words when given a commission from a client to avoid trouble. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

However, politics, economics, ideology, law, and some other so-called “human civilization” become reasons to prevent human uniting together. Is everyone really equal speaking of Climate? 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

It is not the climate that splits us. The climate makes the separation into groups obvious. Although we are talking about the same thing, different phrasing can lead to different results. The antagonism floating on the top makes us too tired to discuss the real important things. The problem within contemporary society is that people refuse to join the discourse. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

Latour mentions two territories, both of which are inhabitable. One is the productive space that keeps us alive. The other is the container for our daily activities in the form of data, part of which lies in Google's or Meta's giant data center. The non-material world does not exist without a physical carrier. The first territory is the place we stand, see and we touch. The second one is much more complicated because it was broken into pieces of a puzzle spreading everywhere. If we collect the pieces of a puzzle in the same physical site, and we try to assemble them, we will get a beast that represent our world but a distorted one. It sounds ridiculous, like finding a chipped fingernail and saying I found someone hiding here. But the reality is that we can indeed find the person through bioinformatics. 

The digital footprints are even harder to eliminate. We have to pray that no one is stalking us and to pretend we are free people. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

Latour brings our attention to the concept of "citizenship" and politics. A lot of people are pessimistic about contemporary society because almost all non-binary problems will eventually turn into political issues. It is always the position instead of the rationality that gives the answer, even in an environment where everyone can use a pseudonym. Our position is limited by our vision. It was determined by origin, identity, education, and environment. Now let's put these advanced topics aside and talk a little bit about how to survive the brutal life adventure. Obviously, we have to be equipped with different philosophies and methods to survive in the two different lands. We should realize that emotion and knowledge are like the string connecting the two doppelgangers. The lifespan and the spirit are shared.  

Different accounts mean different doppelgangers. The doppelgangers can represent the history and may have no relation to the present. I noticed the music recommendation by my 18's account was very different from my 20's account. Algorithms are defeated by fickle humans. Speaking of the internet world, we believe that internet friends can replace friends in the real life to some extent. Some of us put more effort into their accounts than tidying their rooms. It has no problem. I suddenly think of years before people are eager to see or date their internet friends in person. What kind of space do people need now? Shall we listen to our desire when we are designing the space? Who are we designing for? 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

It is irrelevant to the context. If being born in the United States means you are an American, can my digital doppelganger be an American? By the way, it was born on Google's servers in 2015.  

The world is constructed according to the algorithm proposed by modernism. When world-building starts to go wrong, we are patching to correct off-tracks. I wonder is it still the same thing with too many patches? 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 2)</i> 

Globalization always renders an optimistic mood. We see the world through a distorted lens. We empathize with capitalists as if we were rich, too. Like I sometimes cannot help teaching Americans how to spell English words.  

We are so arrogant that we ignore the crisis with peace of mind. Even if we want to react, we are held down by those around us, families, friends, etc. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 2)</i> 

In my understanding, the Anthropocene is an addendum to globalization. The superposition of the Anthropocene and globalization will be the totality of our world. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 2)</i> 

Latour's proposal puts Anthropocene on the same level as individuals. 

In conjunction with the context that follows, Anthropocene is proposed in isolation from human history and attempts to abstract multiple subjectivity into one. I keep prudent towards that as a human being. It does not mean that it is undesirable to make grand narratives from the perspective of a non-human. One have to clarity their detached attitude at the beginning of their storytelling. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

Everybody dreams to be the few. As architects, we should be aware that we are the accomplices of capital, though we sometimes claim that we are environmental agents. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

If human beings no longer exist in human form, do we still need to treat them as the same species? Can Exit solve the problems we are facing? It reminds me of the Peasant Revolts they kill their king and become the new king. History will repeat itself if we keep a blind eye to the issues. The exit will make things even more difficult. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

Choosing Planet EXIT was a big gamble, betting that you would be one of the chosen few. Run-away cannot solve anything but makes things bigger. When the issue is as big as a planet, we have nowhere to hide. 

At that time, arguing about who is the best U.S. president becomes a funny scene. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

Walls provide a sense of solidity. Gravity provides a sense of reality. Those who hide behind walls are not necessarily cowards. They are rational and a little conservative and believe they can find an image from history to deal with the dilemma right now. For some reason, they don't trust themselves. They need tons of references to support their courage. They are the majority, the indigenous people of globalization. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

What is the dream habitat? Is there a place that satisfied the "subsistence, territory, and freedom" needs of its inhabitants? 

We voluntarily build walls to resist external risks. When we ourselves become a risk, we passively and voluntarily isolate ourselves. There exists an invisible wall of consciousness embedded in the culture, or even in the DNA. Human beings may bear to divide themselves. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 4)</i> 

The same is architecture. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 6)</i> 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 6)</i> 

Anthropocene is kind of static because it only describes "here" and "now" and has no relation to the past and future. That is its limitation. But still, a good model to perceive the situation. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 6)</i> 

Yes. Time and space are concepts defined by humans. There used to be no digits in the world. When humans abstract the world into the digits, they possess a new world. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 6)</i> 

Modernism lacks a unified definition and description, which has led to future generations guessing to understand it, and therefore prone to over-interpret or misinterpret it. When we talk about modernism, what are we talking about? Modernism is not only a style.
