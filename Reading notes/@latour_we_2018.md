It is important to frame the field and clarify the definition before we start a conversation in the fluid contemporary context. It is crucial to read the information behind the written words when given a commission from a client. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

However, politics, economics, ideology, law and some other so-called “pearls of human civilization” become reasons to prevent human uniting together. Is everyone really equal speaking of Climate? 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

All human conflicts can be ascribed to the land. If we think of climate and environment as a resource or an innate advantage/disadvantage of development, we can understand why conflicts or compromises exist in the "here" and "now". 

What are we designing for? Our research focuses on  "here" and "now", but our users are in the future. We can get a prediction or several predictions from trained AI models, but they cannot represent the future by Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

Latour mentions two territories, both of which are inhabitable. One is the productive space that is physical, touchable and keeps us alive. The other is more like an immaterial territory of consciousness existing in nowhere or everywhere. Let’s make another assumption that it is a territory on the Cloud, inhabitable as well, only provides advanced survival needs beyond “safety” in Maslow's hierachy. 

Here we know everyone processes two territories that overlap each other. The areas of the territories are not fixed. They can grow as the owner’s perception grows, or shrinks through interpersonal confrontations. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

We are equipped with different philosophies and methods to survive in the two different tanks. Emotion and knowledge are like the string connecting the two doppelgangers. 

There is no doubt that the wounds we get in the physical world need to be healed in a physical clinic. How about the damages from another world? 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 1)</i> 

Climate can't unite humans. Neither can politics. Religious works for sometimes however cause some side effect at the meantime. How about capital? While there have always been critiques about capital and globalization, we have to admit that capital is, at least so far, the only merit that succeeded in binding human beings together. We cannot afford de-globalization. 

As a civilized modern people we cannot avoid questions about citizenship. How to define citizenship? If paying taxes means being a citizen, can we consider a company as a citizen? Are citizenship important for juristic persons like companies? How does capital view citizenship? 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 2)</i> 

It is true that globalization always renders an optimistic mood. Human’s nerves of pain and awareness of crisis have receded like never before. In the contrary, some trivial panic is blown into magnification, diverting everyone's attention away from the real crisis. This has created the spectacle that Musk's tweets attracting more attention than the increasing rent and food prices in our life. This phenomenon also reflects the increase of the unspeakable in human history. We tend to play deaf and practice Wittgenstein's "whatever cannot be said, be silent". 

There is a possibility that the area of world is still sufficient, but more places turns to be inaccessible for some reason, as toxins are everywhere, walls are everywhere, surveillance is everywhere... 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 2)</i> 

In my understanding, the Anthropocene is an addendum to globalization. The superposition of the Anthropocene and globalization will be the totality of our world. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 2)</i> 

This sentence is confusing to me and seems to have a tendency to "make gods". 

In conjunction with the context that follows, Anthropocene is proposed in isolation from human history and attempts to abstract multiple subjectivity into one. I keep prudent towards that as a human being. It does not mean that it is undesirable to make grand narratives from the perspective of a non-human. One have to clarity their detached attitude at the beginning of their storytelling. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

Everybody dreams to be the few. The modernism and globalization have their audience forever. 

As architects we should be aware that we are the accomplices of capital. We still have dream of fairness and justice. But we all know it is a fake glory for the sake of marketing and storytelling. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

Since humans no longer exist in human form, do we still need to treat them as the same species? Hidden behind EXIT is the bloodier issue of race and justice. 

The real world is complicated enough. Why should we bother to fictionalize the new world for discussion? Unless the real world has completely run out of territory. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

Choosing Planet EXIT was a big gamble, betting that you would be one of the chosen few. This may be somehow equitable, whereby talent and wealth are determined at random, rather than from inheritance. 

Migration cannot solve issues but leave the issues behind. If the issues were as big as our planet, or the universe, we would have nowhere to hide. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

The wall and gravity are undoubtedly the two most important elements in Latour's essay. Walls provide sense of solidity and gravity provides sense of materiality. The texture of human beings is not supposed to be smooth, transparent and functional, but should be primitive, muddy and unpredictable. 

It seems like the superposition of the EXIT and SECURITY will be the totality of human beings. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 3)</i> 

If we ask what is the ideal built environment, it would be the one that can provide "subsistence, territory, and freedom" to its inhabitants. 

"subsistence, territory, and freedom" is the eternal pursuit of us Homo sapiens. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 4)</i> 

The same is architecture. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 6)</i> 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 6)</i> 

This paragraph demonstrates the limitation of Anthropocene. Anthropocene can only be used to describe “here” and “now”. It is not for the past or future. It has no variation. It is static. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 6)</i> 

Interesting opinion. Advantage of thinking in perspective of Anthropocene. 

<i>(Latour, 2018, p. 6)</i> 

The problem of Modernism is that it is too smooth and abstract, and therefore prone to over-interpretation or misinterpretation. This is exactly the reason I wanted to trace back to the early modernism when I was planning the thesis.
