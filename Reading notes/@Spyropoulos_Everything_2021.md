## Abstract
---
Director of the Architectural Association Design Research Lab (AADRL) and co-founder of Minimaforms in London, Theodore Spyropoulos describes the necessity to construct artificially intelligent environments that explore our technological sphere so that we may better understand and actively participate in the emerging complexities.

	“The ‘world’, rather than something shared and understood, is plural, situated and in continuous formation.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66) 

We still live in the same physical space, sharing the energy and materials, talking, drinking, and feeling high. It is just the way we perceive the world become less uniform. It is not inherently a bad thing. It just lead to complexities in communication and cause more misunderstandings. Therefore, it is important to check the premise with others before we start a conversation. I have not yet learnt how to make a good desk-critique and control the conversation, which often end in awkward smiles and a more heart-broken "I don't understand".

	“The observer here is understood as human or nonhuman/machine.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66) 

We are so used to do nothing but be a witness. Detachment is one of the major themes of our contemporary life. Sometimes I even think machines are more human than some peers. At least, they auto back-up my files, which avoids tragedies before final review.

	“‘Objectivity is the subject’s delusion that observing can be done without him.’” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66) 

This is a strong statement. It challenges the normative we believe for the whole life. It demonstrates the arrogance of human beings whether we accept the view or not. Here is a sibling question: does objectivity represent some sort of truth? Will objectivity affect the presentation of built world? Maybe not.

	“The certainty of all forms and their representations therefore are cast into doubt.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66) 

We construct the world according to our perceptions. Truth is not important. The forms and their representations are still meaningful to us. It is just that we are so powerless facing the uncertainty of information delivery.

	“Architectural discourses today shy away from uncertainty and complexity.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66) 

The designated ignorance on the changing context will finally lead into nihilism, causing an even deeper detachment to the reality. Our academic world is so ideal that like bubbles. Nobody can answer the question that what is a proper configuration of architecture? What are architects doing? Are they important to our lives as Homo Sapiens? Would I be happier living without knowledge of architecture? I am too tired now.

	“The current lines of thought champion representational models of historical appropriation, dogmatic styles or an all-out rejection of architecture having meaningful social or political agency through design” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66) 

What are we talking about when we talk about architecture? Architecture is not a binary thing. It is OK to represent architecture in a different way from others. They are just time consuming…

	“Rather than illustrating ideas, models should offer us the possibility to engage and respond to the information-rich matrices that influence our everyday.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 66) 

“Model” is both a projection of the past and a prediction for the future. Model can display information more than our expectation. We never know what our audience are attracted by, just like comedy directors are confused why audience are laughing at this point. 

	“Architecture must reconceptualise the role that space as medium can play today by rejecting the historical crutches that reinforce modern and postmodern rehashing.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 69) 

Architecture’s spatial nature will not disappear while some other elements are not under architects’ control. Space is not a cubic area surrounded by surfaces. Surfaces can be categorized as XXX-ism but space is a space. Space means relationship.

	“‘Design then must be considered as durational, real-time and anticipatory exploring human with human, human with machine, and machine with machine communication.The challenge posed is how designers can construct environments that enable curiosity, evolve and allow for complex interactions to arise through human and nonhuman agency. Attention here is placed on behavioural features that afford conversational-rich exchanges between participants and systems, participants with other participants and/ or systems with other systems.This evolving framework demands that design systems have the capacity to participate and enable new forms of communication. Beyond convention architecture moves towards features that are life-like, machine learned, and emotively communicated.’” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 70) 

Design requires working methodologies and project management, collaboration and communication. Design can be fun. Design can end anywhere and have no end.

	“Architecture should foster intuitive and behavioural attributes of communication, giving agency to the collective through their action as influence.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 70) 

We therefore should avoid monotonous, rigid and dead spaces unless we are asked to do so. Here architecture is seen more as a container for human activities.

	“Architecture therefore needs to be an active participant moving beyond finite positions and passive observations towards a truly second-order cybernetic architecture that is both subject and interacting object within the world.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73) 

What is the relationship between architecture and environment? Is architecture part of environment? Or is architecture excluded from environment? Modernism is based on totality which is not “true” and leading to disorders later on.

	“Beyond simplistic relationships that reinforce passive observation, this approach enables each participant to be a performer actively influencing and being influenced within its environment.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73) 

The absolute objectivity does not exist. If we think architecture is environment, architecture will define others. If we strip architecture from environment, architecture is defined by others. We are defined by things around us. History is important. External feedback is important. 

	“Beyond blueprint or master plans, architecture today must argue for space as a medium of communication.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73) 

Architecture is the crossover point for all other discourses. Architecture itself is nothing. Learning architecture won’t make you grow wise but it will make you look smarter. That is one of the lesson from architecture schools. Architecture is always a good form for documenting information physically. However, most architects never realize that. The overload or over-scale in information can lead to incongruity in space. That is a pity and we can avoid that by a rough research on the context. 

	“Through enabling participation and affording agency we may find architecture must break its reliance on representation and notation and move towards the behavioural, offering an understanding of the deeper relationships between things.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73) 

Form and appearance are the least things to think about when implementing a design. We need to answer a series of “why” questions at the vert beginning. From other perspectives, architecture don’t have to be physical and can also exist in an immaterial form, such as Nero.

	“As technologies accelerate the collapse of space and time, architecture remains itself a form of resistance.” (Spyropoulos, 2021, p. 73) 

Technologies changed the way humans perceive space and time, resulting in people nowadays feel space and time are deconstructed by technologies. I still think the technologies are neutral. But we humans are too silly and disdainful.
